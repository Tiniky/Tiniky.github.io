        <h2>About the company</h2>
        <p>Let's jump back in time to the early 2000s. One day in a USC dorm, two business students started talking about the video game industry. That unintantional talk led to the nowadays well known <b>Riot Games</b>.</p>
        <p>In 2006 <i>Brandon Beck</i> and <i>Marc Merill</i> made the first step, they've officially created the <b>Riot Games</b> company. They agreed on making free games while creating ingame contents which can be obtained by spending some money but the main game is enjoyable without them.</p>

        <p>They were looking for people who share their passions and video game affection. Only a little group was working for 4 months on the first game's prototype. This game came out in April of 2009, it's called <b>League of Legends</b>. It only had 17 choosable champ. Today it has over 180 million active monthly players and 159 choosable champ.</p>
        <p>In 2019 they started working on more projects. First we heard about the Project A which later became <b>Valorant</b>. That year was created the <b>Riot Forge</b>, which is a part of <b>Riot Games</b>, that is focused on the company's other game ideas. Their goal is to release new games each year and to let the players have a deeper look in the magical world of <i><b>Runeterra</b></i>.</p>

        <p>A wild <strong>Teemo</strong> has been lost. He is probably hiding in one of the following pages. Find him! He knows the way to our giveaway. Don't forget about the <strong>Teemo</strong> passive, if he stays in one place for long enough he becomes invisible. He is somewhere near I heard his little laugh. Good Luck!</p>
